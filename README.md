# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This website was a short prework study to help me better understand the content I will be working on during the bootcamp. My motivation was to understand the content and hit the ground running when I start learning the main contect of the course. It solves the problem of where to keep my notes during the bootcamp; it is a repo for future notes and tips I should keep in mind during my professional career as a software engineer. I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.

## Installation

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.GIT

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
